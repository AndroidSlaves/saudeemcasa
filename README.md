# saudeemcasa
Project for refactoring SaudeEmCasa app.

The project Saúde em Casa was developed in 2015 by students (Iolane Andrade, Lucas Brilhante, Pedro Ivo de Andrade and Vinicius Carvalho) at the University of Brasilia, graduating in Software Engineering. The Saúde em Casa is an application developed for the Android platform API 19 (KitKat) or higher.

The application aims to serve the patients of private or public health area, who are interested or already registered in the project of support to health by the federal government - "Melhor em Casa" - providing information about the locations (hospitals and clinics) that partner with "Melhor em Casa" program. The application provides data registered hospitals, the list of locations closer to the user, and also traces routes via Google Maps user to the desired setting. In addition, the development team also provides information on the program "Farmácia Popular", and provides the same functionality as listing the nearest pharmacies, information of each establishment, and following a route to the location.

The objective of this project is to improve the quality of the software produced by refactoring code, good practice programming and application programming techniques.
